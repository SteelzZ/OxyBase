=OxyBase=

OxyBase - is a framework meant to help developers to implement custom business logic in DDD(Domain Driven Design) way. That is the most important thing that OxyBase offers! 

OxyBase - is based on so called "CQRS Architecture". This was introduced by Greg Young and I have to say after one year of practical usage - I love it. I think OxyBase is one and only php framework that implements this architecture. 

OxyBase - was tested in real life with real users (actually it is still in production)
