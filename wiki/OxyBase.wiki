#labels DDD,CQRS,OxyBase
=Overview=

In it's first release, till now it was one and only release, OxyBase was just a simple ZF extension that suggested not much - ability to split project in "domains" like front-end, admin and had integrated and ready to use libraries like Doctrine, Smarty. But since then I have learned a lot and now I want to drift away with this project. 

What I am saying is that I will not be focusing on "Front-end" stuff with OxyBase. My idea is to make OxyBase a back-end framework that can be used with any existing php framework. 
Below you will find updated definition.

=OxyBase=

OxyBase - is a framework meant to help developers to implement custom business logic in DDD(Domain Driven Design) way. That is the most important thing that OxyBase offers! 

OxyBase - is based on so called "CQRS Architecture". This was introduced by Greg Young and I have to say after one year of practical usage - I love it. I think OxyBase is one and only php framework that implements this architecture. 

OxyBase - was tested in real life with real users (actually it is still in production)
