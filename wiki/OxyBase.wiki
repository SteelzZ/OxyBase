==OxyBase==

===What is OxyBase in overall?===

OxyBase is a project which aims to provide a use case how to create system which would be *SOA* based, would have *DDD* centric approach, would use *CQRS* architecture inside *service* instance and all this would be done in PHP.

===What OxyBase provides?===

OxyBase has a framework to aid developers while creating *DDD* centric domains that applies *Event Sourcing* pattern, while implementing *CQS pattern* as an application architecture, while publishing application's services/interface over web service, while managing development life-cycle, while deploying application. It also has out of the box ready project structure.

===When you should use OxyBase?===

 * If you have complex domain (very complex business rules)
 * If your project is not data centric
 * If you want to create a back-end application with PHP and integrate it into existing system(does not matter what platform it's built on)
 * If you have experienced developers team
 * If you know what is OOP
 * If you know what is DDD 
 * If it's likely that your entities will have to handle concurrent requests
 * If you need Sagas  

===When you should not use OxyBase?===

You can use it for any kind of project, but more likely that you will not benefit from packages and features it provides. 
Although, if you will try to implement some small, not complex application by using all those "things" described above - most likely that you will fail, because it will be just to much work and very little benefit.
