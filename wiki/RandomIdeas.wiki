Here i'll put my random ideas that later perhaps will compile in sme posts.

* What about setup like, having Apache/PHP for front-end clients to render data and issue commands to message bus and then Axis2 to handle WebServices part, also will do nothing more just read from reporting and issuing commands to message bus. Behind message bus we will have - anything we want becaue messages will be XML based ? 
OxyBase could help here by creating backend domain models that would process those messages. Why not ? It's startup company you wont have billions of messages per day PHP will handle it. Developers are cheap, easy to find, and if framework is right it will do the work and once time will come for something more advanced we can always replace those domains with anything we want, no ?

* Axis2 has WS-* implementations and PHP does not (well it does but it just does not work), let's use Axis2, it's tested it's enterprise it's easy to start with. Offer "PHP way" but recommend something more advanced.
