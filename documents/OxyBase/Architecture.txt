= Overview =
OxyBase is PHP framework which main goal is to provide robust features set that are required
by enterprise applications. Idea is to have a configurable, flexible framework that would have everything 
what is needed and that developers would be able to amend it to their needed way.
OxyBase aims not to be tied to any existing framework, instead it aims to support any of those.
OxyBase strives to have integrated all the best php components living out there.

= CQRS Architecture =
== Overview ==
OxyBase by default is configured to support CQRS architecture. More about it read here.
Every single write operation should go through the writing (later in this document we will call it WS) side,
and all reading operations should go through the reading side (RS).

Every writing operation is a command, for example DoCreateCustomer, DoChangeAddress, DoAcceptTermsAndConditions.
Command is nothing more than a class with a bunch of properties.
